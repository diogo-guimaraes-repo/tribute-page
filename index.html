        <blockquote id="quote" cite="John Petrucci">When I think of a lot of the players I admire, they could always
          play their parts without hiding behind distortion and sustain. Put the time in. Hear your mistakes. Yeah, it
          sucks, it's humbling, it makes you want to throw the guitar out the window.
          But if you work on your mistakes, they'll eventually go away, and you'll become a strong player.</p>
